##### A dataset is composed of age and weight data for several people. This dataset is an example of "structured" data because it is represented as an array in a computer. True/False?
 - [ ] False 
 - [x] True


##### Which of the following are examples of unstructured data? Choose all that apply.

##### Assuming the trends described in the figure are accurate. The performance of a NN depends only on the size of the NN. True/False?

- [ ] False
- [x] True

##### In this diagram which we hand-drew in the lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent. 
- [x] • x-axis is the amount of data               • y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.
- [ ] • x-axis is the input to the algorithm       • y-axis is outputs.
- [ ] • x-axis is the performance of the algorithm • y-axis (vertical axis) is the amount of data.
- [ ] • x-axis is the amount of data               • y-axis is the size of the model you train.

##### When experienced deep learning engineers work on a new problem, they can usually use insight from previous problems to train a good model on the first try, without needing to iterate multiple times through different models. True/False?
- [x] False
- [ ] True

##### Which of the following are reasons that didn't allow Deep Learning to be developed during the '80s?
- [x] Limited computational power.
- [ ] The theoretical tools didn't exist during the 80's.
